<p>Jalapeno poppers were believed to have originated in the 1970s in Texas. </p> 
<p>It is believed that it originated as an alternative version of chiles</p>
<p>rellenos with a tex-mex style to it. The Dish is a jalapeno stuffed with</p>
<p>a mix of cheese, meat, and spices then breaded and cooked.  </p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>My family grows the jalapenos by ourselves for extra flavor and taste </p>
<p>(but the ones in the photo were bought at the store) The contents that </p>
<p>fill the jalapenos are a mix of ground beef, onions and cheese mixed together.</p>
<p>After cooked and stuffed into the jalapenos cheese and breadcrumbs are added</p>
<p>on top. </p>

<p>My family has had this recipe for not very long but it is still a family favorite. </p>
<p>My grandmother learned it from one of her cousins in the early 2000s and I'm not </p>
<p>sure where it came from before that. This meal has been a big part of family celebrations</p>
<p>for years and will continue to be for at least my whole life. I will make sure of this.</p>
